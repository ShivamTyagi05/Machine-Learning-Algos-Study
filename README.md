# Machine-Learning-Algos-Study
Theses codes helps you to easily understand the implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms.

These are basic Machine Learning Algorithms which we further use in our project.
Data preprocession file is not a ML algo, it is to convert the data into required form to implement the algorithm.

The datasets are downloarded from:
